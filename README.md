# A109ET-IoTGreenhouseProject
This is the repository for the source codes for the IoT Greenhouse Project 

Each of the folders represents each section of the components.
The Frontend folder must be made into a build application by "npm run build" with ReactJS, and be copied to the backend/front-end before deployment.
